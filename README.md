Hi Guys!

I Built Language Translation app with nodejs.

You can run this the application by typing the text of the language you want first in "source.txt". and then in your CLI, you just open directory "Google-Translate-API", next you type in your CLI like this

npm lib/index

Voila.. the translation result are automatic available in "target.txt"

Important:
the application only translates from english to indonesian

Thanks 😁
